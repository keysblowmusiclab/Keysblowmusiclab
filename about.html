    <p>Hi! I’m Juan Gutiérrez, a professional clarinetist, conductor and passionate music educator. 
    I studied music formally and graduated with a degree in Music Education. I’ve had the privilege of 
    performing as a clarinetist with the Bogotá Philharmonic Orchestra, and I’ve worked with students of 
    all ages — from young beginners to advanced performers — in Colombia and Australia.</p>
    <p>As an experienced conductor, I’ve led youth bands and ensembles in public performances and competitions. 
    My goal is to inspire students, help them find their unique sound, and enjoy every step of their musical journey.</p>
